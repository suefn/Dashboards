## Context

- The client intended to mobilize sales campaigns with us and we took the opportunity to propose a package that also included campaign performance monitoring.
- Analysis based on data from the current year (so that when the year ends, monitoring starts again).
- Focused mainly on product, salespeople, quantity sold and revenue as parameters.

## Objectives

- Monitor the progress of the campaign from January 1 to December 31, which includes monitoring how much of the goal is being met and how salespeople are performing (for the purpose of rewarding them at the end of the year).
- In addition to analyzing which products perform best and which stores excelled in revenue and target as well.
