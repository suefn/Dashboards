## Context
- We proposed a comparative analysis to the client before starting campaign strategies in order to analyze how sales have been performing in recent years comparatively.
- It is strategic, but is not used for immediate decision-making purposes.
- Main parameters are product, number of customers and orders, and quantity sold.

## Objectives
- Gradual and long-term monitoring of sales, purchase frequency, and orders
- Performance comparisons in relation to the previous year to observe growth.
